# 60 days of code

_Challenge based on the [#100daysofcode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) to improve programming logic and problem solving in 3 months._

### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Improve my basic skills as programmer by creating tipical problems that I have had when I was student, in some code interviews and more new hard problems from internet.

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least two hours every day for the next 60 weekdays.*

#### Start Date
January 11th, 2021.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every weekday so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and commit programm here so that others can see my progress.
5. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
