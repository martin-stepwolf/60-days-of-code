## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least one hours every day for the next 43 weekdays.*

#### Start Date
January 11th, 2021.

#### End Date
April 19th, 2021.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every weekday so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and commit programm here so that others can see my progress.
5. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
