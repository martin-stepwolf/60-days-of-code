# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Organize and accept the challenge according to the first OKR of this year and create the repository.

**Thoughts:** More than libraries, frameworks and programming language, it is time to give a time to focus on improve my programming logic and problem solving by solving typical problems as IT Engineer (being efficient and optimizing the code).

### Day 2: January 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basic about regular expression (regex) and create a programm in python with validations to define what the user typed.

**Thoughts:** An powerful programming tool to search and/or validate data as text, email, url, name, phone number or any information with an specific pattern. Many pattern does not work as I want, so they were commented at the moment.

### Day 3: January 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn more about regular expression (regex) and, create more expressions and optimize the initial programm.

**Thoughts:** Even the regex are powerful, this is only a tool, more validations is done by the programming language (examples about Ipv4 and geographical coordinates in the programm).
