# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Organize and accept the challenge according to the first OKR of this year and create the repository.

**Thoughts:** More than libraries, frameworks and programming language, it is time to give a time to focus on improve my programming logic and problem solving by solving typical problems as IT Engineer (being efficient and optimizing the code).

### Day 2: January 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basic about regular expression (regex) and create a program in python with validations to define what the user typed.

**Thoughts:** An powerful programming tool to search and/or validate data as text, email, url, name, phone number or any information with an specific pattern. Many pattern does not work as I want, so they were commented at the moment.

**File:** [1-regex-validations.py](1-regex-validations.py)

### Day 3: January 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn more about regular expression (regex) and, create more expressions and optimize the initial program.

**Thoughts:** Even the regex are powerful, this is only a tool, more validations is done by the programming language (examples about Ipv4 and geographical coordinates in the program).

**File:** [1-regex-validations.py](1-regex-validations.py)

### Day 4: January 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program to search, validate and compare (with regular expression) data in a csv file.

**Thoughts:** Data validation by saving data (defined by pharentesis and save it as $1, $2, $n) given by the same regular expression. In the program I could validate the format of the data and get the matches won by visitors (using the variables of the regex), in the past I would split the data in commas and saved in an array and use a lot a ifs and for loop).

**File:** [2-regex-searching.pl](2-regex-searching.pl)

### Day 5: January 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program to convert a csv file in sql file (with regular expression).

**Thoughts:** Regex besides of validate the data, the saved data (defined by pharentesis and save it as $1, $2, $n) could be used to generate other type of file with the same information, in this case the data were converted to a sql file, but it could be in json, xml or any other format.

**File:** [3-regex-conversion.php](2-regex-conversion.php)

### Day 6: January 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Clean a school project to implement regular expresions.

**Thoughts:** A better solution instead of split arrays, use a lot for and ifs. In any project the focus is to solve the problem, as student I have comitted many mistakes although the problem is solved is great to have better knowledge.

**Repository:** [Basic Web Scraping](https://github.com/martin-stepwolf/basic-web-scraping)

### Day 7: January 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implement regex in data cleaning.

**Thoughts:** A better solution in contrast to the past one. In that moment for everyone the better solution was the one that works without taking into account scalability and performance, normal things as beginners.

**Repository:** [Basic Web Scraping](https://github.com/martin-stepwolf/basic-web-scraping)

### Day 8: January 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Improve the last project and release the version 2.0.0.

**Thoughts:** Last thing I did about regex, a really useful tool I would like to know well in that school project.

**Repository:** [Basic Web Scraping version 2.0.0](https://github.com/martin-stepwolf/basic-web-scraping/releases/tag/2.0.0)

### Day 9: January 21th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Basic RSA generator (public and private key).

**Thoughts:** Following the step I lerned at the university and review Java I created the program with good practices (functions, constant, commentaries, etc).

**Repository:** [Rsa Algorithm Generator](rsa_algorithm/RsaAlgorithmGenerator.java)

### Day 10: January 25th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program with a callback function.

**Thoughts:** I used to make callbacks in JQuery but I did not know about its functionality and that its name is higher-order function because it gets a function as parameter and return a function.

**Repository:** [Asynchronism Callback](4.-asynchronism-callback.js)

### Day 11: January 26th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program like the pas one with a promises.

**Thoughts:** A better code generated by promises and it does the same like with callback.

**Repository:** [Asynchronism Promises](5.-asynchronism-promises.js)

### Day 12: January 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program like the past with a async await.

**Thoughts:** The three way to handle asynchronism in Javascript, each one with its advantages and disadvantages. Async Await looks better and now I will code better.

**Repository:** [Asynchronism Async Await](6.-asynchronism-async-await.js)

### Day 13: January 28th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a basic calculator with Go language.

**Thoughts:** Interesting features in this language, for one reason many companies use it, its syntax and structure are simple. And I used my knowledge about regular expression, a powerful tool I dominated days ago.

**Repository:** [Basic Calculator](7-basic-calculator.go)

### Day 14: February 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a basic user list with Go language.

**Thoughts:** Some new concepts I learned, like structs and how Go manages the variables with pointers.

**Repository:** [User List](8-user-list.go)

### Day 15: February 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a request to get data from a website with go.

**Thoughts:** A new way to get data using some packages from go, here the interfaces are used a lot and it makes the interface implicitly.

**Repository:** [Web Get](9-web-get.go)

### Day 16: February 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program to evaluate if a website works.

**Thoughts:** I learn about Go routines and channels to run processes in the background and receive a response, a so useful tool for the performance, each function does not need to wait the other functions to run.

**Repository:** [Go Routines and Channels](10-routines-channels.go)

### Day 17: February 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Start with a project about a Google clone.

**Thoughts:** A little practice before to learn more things about css and html. I make the main structure and the header.

**Repository:** [Google clone](google-clone)

### Day 18: February 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finish the Google clone.

**Thoughts:** A good practice about HTML semantic and CSS, also it works like google, it send the data to the real Google website.

**Repository:** [Google clone](google-clone)

### Day 19: February 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Start basic programs with bash shell.

**Thoughts:** Learn main things about scripting and create two basic programs with the fundamentals, I have started with other useful tool to automate processes, in this case I am going to automate some processes about databases in PosgreSQL.

**Repository:** [Bash Shell](bash-shell)

### Day 20: February 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program in bash shell to ask some information about the user.

**Thoughts:** Different ways to read a information by the user, also the regular expression could be used here, powerful tool I learned the first days of this challenge.

**Repository:** [User Information](bash-shell/03-user-information.sh)

### Day 21: February 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program in bash shell to compare two numbers.

**Thoughts:** I learned more about shell bash, structured programming where if, for, while and more can be used like the normal programming languages.

**Repository:** [Numbers Comparison](bash-shell/04-number-comparison.sh)

### Day 22: February 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program in bash shell to manage backups.

**Thoughts:** With all the basic knowledge about the CLI and bash shell I create a useful program to create and delete files stored as backups with a log to know about the action.

**Repository:** [Backups](bash-shell/05-backups.sh)

### Day 23: February 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implement packaging with tar, gzip and zip in the program to manage backups.

**Thoughts:** Useful tool when the files to backup is heavy and many option to packaging with and without password.

**Repository:** [Backups](bash-shell/05-backups.sh)

### Day 24: February 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implement functions and better code in the program to manage backups.

**Thoughts:** Now with functions and all the knowledge I improve the code in general to give more scalability and avoid hard coding and.

**Repository:** [Backups](bash-shell/05-backups.sh)

### Day 25: February 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create the environment to learn testing with Jest and I created my first basic test.

**Repository:** [Jest practices](jest-practices/)

### Day 26: February 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implement testing to my project basic web scraping.

**Thoughts:** In the day 8 i implemented regex, now i implemented testing, evaluate the main functions that clean the code and text, and also I refactored the code, split filters from functions.

**Repository:** [Basic Web Scraping branch testing-jest](https://github.com/martin-stepwolf/basic-web-scraping/tree/refactor/testing-jest)

### Day 27: February 21th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implement testing coverage to my project basic web scraping.

**Thoughts:** With coverage I can watch which functions are tested and which one not, and I implemented testing in all filters and some functions.
