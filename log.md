# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Organize and accept the challenge according to the first OKR of this year and create the repository.

**Thoughts:** More than libraries, frameworks and programming language, it is time to give a time to focus on improve my programming logic and problem solving by solving typical problems as IT Engineer (being efficient and optimizing the code).
