# 60 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Organize and accept the challenge according to the first OKR of this year and create the repository.

**Thoughts:** More than libraries, frameworks and programming language, it is time to give a time to focus on improve my programming logic and problem solving by solving typical problems as IT Engineer (being efficient and optimizing the code).

### Day 2: January 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basic about regular expression (regex) and create a programm in python with validations to define what the user typed.

**Thoughts:** An powerful programming tool to search and/or validate data as text, email, url, name, phone number or any information with an specific pattern. Many pattern does not work as I want, so they were commented at the moment.

**File:** [1-regex-validations.py](1-regex-validations.py)

### Day 3: January 13th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn more about regular expression (regex) and, create more expressions and optimize the initial programm.

**Thoughts:** Even the regex are powerful, this is only a tool, more validations is done by the programming language (examples about Ipv4 and geographical coordinates in the programm).

### Day 4: January 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program to search, validate and compare (with regular expression) data in a csv file.

**Thoughts:** Data validation by saving data (defined by pharentesis and save it as $1, $2, $n) given by the same regular expression. In the program I could validate the format of the data and get the matches won by visitors (using the variables of the regex), in the past I would split the data in commas and saved in an array and use a lot a ifs and for loop).

### Day 5: January 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Create a program to convert a csv file in sql file (with regular expression).

**Thoughts:** Regex besides of validate the data, the saved data (defined by pharentesis and save it as $1, $2, $n) could be used to generate other type of file with the same information, in this case the data were converted to a sql file, but it could be in json, xml or any other format.

**File:** [3-regex-conversion.php](2-regex-conversion.php)

### Day 6: January 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Clean a school project to implement regular expresions.

**Thoughts:** A better solution instead of split arrays, use a lot for and ifs. In any project the focus is to solve the problem, as student I have comitted many mistakes although the problem is solved is great to have better knowledge.

**Repository:** [Basic Web Scraping](https://github.com/martin-stepwolf/basic-web-scraping)
